# Knot-and-Cross_Game
You play against a computer in Knots and Crosses, computer goes first cause then its harder to win. Uses a command based input and prints out the board
through printing. 

Did it cause I was bored.

Uses weightings for each position to help the computer to decide where to add a cross or knot.

Not actually that hard to beat, depending on where the program initially decide to place cross or knot

Now it has comments
